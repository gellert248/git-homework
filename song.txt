When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be".
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be".

Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be.
For though they may be parted,
There is still a chance that they will see.
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be.
There will be an answer, let it be.

Let it be, let it be,
Let it be, let it be.
